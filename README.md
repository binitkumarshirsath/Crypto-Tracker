# Crypto Tracker App 🚀

This is my first **Jetpack Compose** project – a **Crypto Tracker App** that provides real-time cryptocurrency data with a modern UI. The app has two main screens: a **list screen** displaying cryptocurrencies and a **details screen** providing more information about each coin.

## Tech Stack 🛠️

The app is built using the following technologies:

- **Jetpack Compose**: For building the UI in a declarative way.
- **Koin DI**: A lightweight dependency injection library for clean and testable code.
- **Ktor Client**: A client for making HTTP requests to fetch cryptocurrency data.
- **Kotlin Serialization**: For serializing and deserializing JSON data from the API.
- **Canvas API**: Used to create custom visualizations and charts.
- **Material3 Components**: For modern UI design with Material Design components.
- **Clean Architecture**: Separating concerns into layers for maintainability and scalability.
- **Adaptive Navigation**: Ensures smooth navigation and UX across different devices.

## Features ✨

- **Crypto List**: Displays a list of popular cryptocurrencies with real-time data.
- **Coin Details**: Click on a coin to view more details like price, market cap, and percentage changes.
- **Responsive Design**: The app adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.
- **Material3 UI**: Modern, clean, and user-friendly interface.

## Architecture 🏗️

This app follows **Clean Architecture** principles with layers for:

1. **Presentation Layer**: Jetpack Compose UI components.
2. **Domain Layer**: Business logic and use cases.
3. **Data Layer**: Networking, data models, and repositories.
